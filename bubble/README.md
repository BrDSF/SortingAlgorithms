* Time Complexity 
->The best case of the algorithm it's when the array is already sorted, so, the time complexity is O(n);

->The worst case is when the array is not totally sorted, so, the time complexity is O(n^2), the two fors
will run and swap all elements;

Spacial Complexity
->O(1), it's because there are no need additional memory, just the loop variables and swapping variables
